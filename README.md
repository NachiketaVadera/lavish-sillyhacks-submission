# lavish-sillyhacks-submission
A Flask app that matches people based on their ability to play a simple game together. 

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project was the eagerness to win this hackathon. We discussed so many ideas and so many concepts before coming to a conclusion. It is a wholesome story of fun and learn.

## What it does

This is an application made to match you with a dating partner based on the statistics of the game which you play together on the website. The game is a simple coordination based games where you control some movements of the character and your partner controls the other and based on how well you coordinate, we're trying to match-make you.

## How we built it

We built it using Flask & the Frontend Web Trinity (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). We also made use of jQuery for better code. 

Apart from that, we used our GitHub Student Education Pack to get PyCharm. We also made use of Auth0 Authentication API.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The project that we made for this hackathon is based on an idea after some serious brainstorming and we're glad that we are able to make this project in such short time duration while also learning about various new technologies.

## What we learned

We learned how to work collaboratively on a project and how to raise each other's spirits while working on the project and teach and learn from each other and the community.

## What's next for Lavish - A Play of Dates | Play2Match

We plan to publish this website and make it available to everyone. There are certainly many tweaks and performance changes needed to be done and will be done in the due course of time.
